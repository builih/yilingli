We explored camera-in-the-loop (CITL) computer-generated holography (CGH) for 3D nanoscale printing in photosensitive resin by training neural networks to account for optical aberrations in a 4f optical system with metasurfaces and spatial light modulators.
We corrected for speckle, pixel cross-talk, and zeroth order light to improve the consistency of simulated and experimental holograms.
