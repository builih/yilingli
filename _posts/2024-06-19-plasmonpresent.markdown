While solid-state upconversion systems promise applications in solar cells, photoredox catalysis, and bioimaging; most require tremendous optical power to achieve maximum upconversion efficiency. In this work, we lower this required optical power by using the concentrated electric field of surface plasmons generated from an organic light emitting diode.
